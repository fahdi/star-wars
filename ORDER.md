As of my last update in April 2023, the "Star Wars" saga includes three main trilogies, two anthology films, and several series. The order in which you watch them can vary depending on whether you want to follow the chronological order of the story's universe, the order of release, or a more thematic approach. Here are a few common viewing orders:

4. **Ultimate Order (including series):**
   - This order includes all movies and the major series, watched in chronological order. The series should be watched in their entirety in their respective places in the timeline. As of my last update, this includes "The Mandalorian," "The Book of Boba Fett," "Obi-Wan Kenobi," "Andor," "The Bad Batch," "Star Wars: Rebels," and "Star Wars: The Clone Wars." The exact placement of each series in the timeline can be easily found online.

Remember, these are just suggested orders. You might find other variations or create your own order based on your preferences. Additionally, new "Star Wars" content may have been released after my last update, so you might want to check for any new releases.
